          Well before joining the Metis team, Lillian lived in Seattle, WA where she started a career as a Technical Recruiter, working and building relationships with companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Expedia. Like most girls who have watched too much Sex and the City, she decided to pack up her bags and move to the Big Apple. Since the move, she has worked for two start-ups and one digital advertising agency.  Lillian is passionate about building relationships and helping others achieve their goals. In her spare time, she loves to travel, sip wine on her terrace, and indulge in amazing food, culture, and music. Her door is always open and she is committed to our studentâ€™s success.
